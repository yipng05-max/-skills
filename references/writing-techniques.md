## 综合技术

### 1. 共识综合（Agreement Synthesis）
将多项得出相似结论的研究合并为一个论点：

```
"A growing body of research has demonstrated that [conclusion]
(Author1, Year; Author2, Year; Author3, Year)."
```

```
"Converging evidence from [method1] (Author1, Year), [method2]
(Author2, Year), and [method3] (Author3, Year) suggests that..."
```

### 2. 分歧综合（Disagreement Synthesis）
对比不同研究的矛盾发现，提炼深层问题：

```
"While some scholars argue that [viewA] (Author1, Year; Author2, Year),
others contend that [viewB] (Author3, Year; Author4, Year). This
inconsistency may stem from [possible explanation]."
```

```
"The relationship between X and Y remains contested. Studies in [contextA]
report positive effects (Author1, Year), whereas research in [contextB]
finds null or negative effects (Author2, Year), suggesting important
boundary conditions that warrant further investigation."
```

### 3. 演进综合（Evolution Synthesis）
呈现研究主题的发展历程和转向：

```
"Early research on [topic] focused primarily on [aspect1] (Author1, Year;
Author2, Year). Over time, scholarly attention shifted toward [aspect2]
(Author3, Year), and more recently, scholars have begun to explore
[aspect3] (Author4, Year; Author5, Year). Despite this evolution,
[gap] remains underexplored."
```

### 4. 条件综合（Conditional Synthesis）
揭示调节条件或边界效应：

```
"The effect of X on Y appears to be contingent upon [moderator]. Specifically,
[relationship] is stronger when [condition1] (Author1, Year), but weaker or
absent when [condition2] (Author2, Year)."
```

## 批判性评价技术

### 方法层面批评
- "However, these studies predominantly relied on [method limitation], which constrains our ability to draw causal inferences."
- "A notable limitation of this body of work is the overreliance on [specific method/sample/context]."
- "While these findings are informative, the cross-sectional nature of existing research precludes causal claims."

### 理论层面批评
- "Although [theory] provides a useful starting point, it fails to account for [specific aspect]."
- "The theoretical mechanisms underlying this relationship remain insufficiently specified."
- "Existing theoretical accounts offer competing predictions regarding [specific question]."

### 实证覆盖层面批评
- "Notably absent from this literature is attention to [specific gap]."
- "This body of research has been conducted almost exclusively in [context], raising questions about generalizability."
- "Despite extensive research on [broad topic], the specific role of [variable] has been overlooked."

## 研究空白识别话术

### 直接空白声明
- "To our knowledge, no prior study has examined..."
- "Despite its theoretical importance, [topic] has received scant empirical attention."
- "This gap is surprising given that..."

### 间接空白导入
- "While the direct effect of X on Y is well-established, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood."
- "Existing research provides valuable insights into [what's known], yet offers limited guidance on [what's unknown]."
- "The literature has made significant progress in understanding [aspect1], but has largely neglected [aspect2]."

### 空白的重要性论证
- "Understanding [gap topic] is critical because..."
- "Addressing this gap has both theoretical and practical implications."
- "Without examining [gap], our understanding of [broader phenomenon] remains incomplete."

## 引文密度与引用策略

### 引文密度原则
- 每段通常包含5-12条引用
- 主题句后的支撑证据应引用3+来源
- 关键论点应有多源支撑，非关键背景可单源

### 引用组织策略
- **括号内多源引用**：按字母序或年份排列
  - `(Adams, 2018; Chen, 2020; Liu, 2019)`
- **嵌入式引用**：突出特定贡献
  - `As Smith (2020) demonstrated, ...`
  - 仅在该作者的具体贡献非常重要时使用
- **综述引用**：引用已有综述而非重复其所有来源
  - `(for a comprehensive review, see Johnson, 2022)`

## 差异对比

| 维度 | 顶刊文献综述 | 博士论文文献综述 |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 长度 | 2-5页 | 30-80页 |
| 目的 | 论证研究空白，支撑研究设计 | 展示全面的文献掌握 |
| 组织 | 主题式、论证式 | 可以是时间式或逐篇式 |
| 覆盖 | 战略性选取，服务论证 | 力求全面、穷尽 |
| 语气 | 简洁、犀利、目的明确 | 可以较为描述性 |
| 批判 | 精准指出与本文相关的局限 | 全面评价各研究优缺点 |
| 结构 | 漏斗型，指向研究空白 | 可以是百科全书式 |
| 文献关系 | 强调脉络、演进、交汇 | 可以独立讨论各研究 |

## 文献演进脉络的呈现方法

### 三阶段演进法
```
开创期："Pioneering work by [Author] (Year) first established..."
发展期："Subsequent research extended this by..." / "Building on this foundation..."
前沿期："Most recently, scholars have begun to..." / "Emerging research suggests..."
→ 空白："Yet, despite these advances, [gap] remains unaddressed."
```

### 范式转换法
```
旧范式："Traditionally, researchers approached [topic] from [perspective1]..."
转折点："However, [Author]'s (Year) seminal work challenged this view by..."
新范式："This shift prompted a new wave of research focusing on..."
→ 空白："While this new paradigm has advanced our understanding of [aspect],
it has not yet addressed [specific issue]."
```

### 多线索汇聚法
```
线索A："One stream of research has focused on..."
线索B："A parallel stream has examined..."
汇聚点："Although these two streams have developed largely independently,
their intersection presents fertile ground for..."
→ 空白："Specifically, [integration point] has not been explored."
```
